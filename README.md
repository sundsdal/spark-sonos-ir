# spark-sonos-ir
Spark Core application to control my sonos with my samsung remote.

Focus for now is just to be able to control the volume with my Samsung remote. But I have recorded my Apple remote in case I want to control other things

Copied the http code from here: https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient with minor modifications

Please take my code and do what you will with it. Be kind. I can only code for short periods of time, so I have to make do with bad code.
